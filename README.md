# Hey there, fellow voyager! 🚀♟️

## Who am I ?

👋 A passionate coder and chess enthusiast. A seeker of elegant solutions and a strategist on both the 64 squares and in the realm of algorithms.
.

## What I Do

🌐 In the world of code, I specialize in python(core/ flask/Django), sql, Java (springboot) . Every challenge is an opportunity to blend my passion for logic and innovation.

♟️ When it comes to chess, I'm not just a player; I'm a strategist. The same logical thinking that drives my coding is applied with tricky to complex positions, formulating plans, and executing tactics.

## What Drives Me

🔍 Problem-solving is at the core of my existence. I view challenges as invitations to create, to innovate, and to sharpen my skills. Whether it's debugging a stubborn bug or devising a winning combination, the thrill of untangling complexity keeps me hooked.

🌌 Imagination is my secret weapon. From lines of code that defy expectations to chess moves that redefine strategy, I believe that the fusion of logic and creativity holds the key to unlocking new horizons.
